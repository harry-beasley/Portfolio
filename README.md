# Harry Beasley's Data Analytics Portfolio

## About Me

Hi, I'm Harry Beasley, a recent graduate with a Master's in Business Analytics from Adelphi University. I have a passion for using data to derive insights and inform decision-making processes. With hands-on experience in machine learning, data visualization, and analytics, I bring strong analytical and problem-solving skills to the table. My background includes roles as a Graduate Assistant Data Analyst and a professional soccer player, which have equipped me with excellent teamwork and leadership abilities.

## Skills

**Programming:**
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Beautiful Soup, NLTK)

**Databases:**
- SQL, NoSQL (MongoDB)

**BI & Visualization:**
- Power BI, Tableau, Excel

## Portfolio Overview

This repository contains a selection of projects that showcase my skills and experience in data analytics. Each project includes a brief description, key aspects, and links to the project files and code.

### Featured Projects

#### Multi-Class Prediction of Obesity Risk

This project involves building a multi-class prediction model to assess obesity risk based on various health and demographic factors.

**Key Aspects:**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Standard scaling, median imputation, and OneHotEncoding for categorical columns.
- **Feature Engineering:** Standardization and encoding of features.
- **Model Selection:** Gradient Boosting and Decision Tree algorithms.
- **Pipeline Creation:** Streamlined preprocessing and model application.
- **Model Optimization:** Hyperparameter tuning and feature selection.

#### Grocery Store Demand Forecasting

A group project focused on building a machine learning model to forecast inventory levels for a grocery store.

**Key Aspects:**
- **Data Collection and Integration:** Merged datasets for sales, stores, and products.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified trends and anomalies through visualizations.
- **Model Development and Evaluation:** Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.
- **Feature Engineering and Selection:** Angular encoding for temporal features and scaling.
- **Model Prediction and Aggregation:** Used XGBoost to predict demand and adjust inventory levels.
