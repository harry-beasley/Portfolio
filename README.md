### Projects

### Analysis of Earnings Calls: Unveiling Insights and Categorizing Stocks in the ARKK ETF
This project leverages automation and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze earnings call transcripts of various companies.

**Key Aspects:**
- Web Mining: Used Selenium to extract earnings call URLs.
- ETL and NLP: Processed transcripts using BeautifulSoup and spaCy.
- Supervised Learning: Logistic Regression for stock categorization.
- Unsupervised Learning: LDA for topic modeling.
- Outcome Analysis: Identified key factors influencing stock performance.

### ETF Recommender Project - Part 2
The second part focuses on analyzing the ETF data to identify similar ETFs and recommend new investment ideas using clustering and association rule mining techniques.

**Key Aspects:**
- Similarity Analysis: Calculated Jaccard and cosine similarities between ETFs.
- Expense Ratio Extraction: Gathered data using Selenium.
- Apriori Algorithm: Identified strong association rules among stocks.
- Feature Engineering and Clustering: Applied KMeans clustering to categorize stocks.
- Cluster-Based Recommendations: Recommended ETFs based on cluster analysis.
