        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Harry Beasley, a recent graduate with a Master's in Business Analytics from Adelphi University. I'm passionate about using data to drive insights and make informed decisions. Skilled in Python, SQL, Tableau, and Excel, I have hands-on experience in machine learning, data visualization, and analytics. My background as a Graduate Assistant Data Analyst and a professional soccer player has equipped me with strong analytical, problem-solving, and teamwork skills. Here is my portfolio where you can find examples of my work and projects I've completed.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/harry-beasley/portfolio/tree/main/multi-class-prediction-obesity-risk" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none;"><strong>Multi-Class Prediction of Obesity Risk</strong></a></h3>
            <p>This project involves building a multi-class prediction model to assess obesity risk based on various health and demographic factors.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Applied standard scaling and median imputation for numerical columns to handle missing values and ensure balanced feature contribution. Categorical columns were processed using constant imputation and OneHotEncoding.</li>
              <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Implemented feature engineering techniques to standardize numerical features and encode categorical features, facilitating their use in the machine learning models.</li>
              <li><strong>Model Selection:</strong> Utilized Gradient Boosting and Decision Tree algorithms to capture non-linear relationships and compare their capabilities in predicting obesity risk levels.</li>
              <li><strong>Pipeline Creation:</strong> Developed a pipeline to streamline preprocessing and model application, ensuring seamless handling of testing data.</li>
              <li><strong>Model Optimization:</strong> Explored hyperparameter tuning and feature selection/creation to enhance the performance of the Decision Tree algorithm, aiming to improve precision for smaller sample classifications.</li>

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/harry-beasley/portfolio/tree/main/grocery-store-inventory-forecasting" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none;"><strong>Grocery Store Demand Forecasting</strong></a></h3>
            <p>This group project involved building a machine learning model to forecast inventory levels for a grocery store. My specific contributions included:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Data Collection and Integration:</strong> Downloaded and merged datasets for sales, stores, and products. Conducted feature engineering by creating new temporal features and converting categorical variables.</li>
              <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Performed thorough EDA to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies. Generated histograms and line plots to visualize sales data across different dimensions such as product name, product category, store number, and date.</li>
              <li><strong>Model Development and Evaluation:</strong> Developed and fine-tuned multiple machine learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Evaluated model performance using metrics like R-squared, MAE, MSE, and RMSE to select the best model.</li>
              <li><strong>Feature Engineering and Selection:</strong> Created new features such as angular encoding for temporal features and applied scaling and one-hot encoding through a pipeline. Dropped redundant features to enhance model performance.</li>
              <li><strong>Model Prediction and Aggregation:</strong> Used the final XGBoost model to predict demand and adjusted inventory levels. Aggregated data to predict weekly inventory for each store-product combination, ensuring the model's RMSE was within acceptable limits.</li>
            </ul>
