        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Harry Beasley, a recent graduate with a Master's in Business Analytics from Adelphi University. I'm passionate about using data to drive insights and make informed decisions. Skilled in Python, SQL, Tableau, and Excel, I have hands-on experience in machine learning, data visualization, and analytics. My background as a Graduate Assistant Data Analyst and a professional soccer player has equipped me with strong analytical, problem-solving, and teamwork skills. Here is my portfolio where you can find examples of my work and projects I've completed.</p>

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3><strong>Multi-Class Prediction of Obesity Risk</strong></h3>
            <p>This project involves building a multi-class prediction model to assess obesity risk based on various health and demographic factors.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Applied standard scaling and median imputation for numerical columns to handle missing values and ensure balanced feature contribution. Categorical columns were processed using constant imputation and OneHotEncoding.</li>
              <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Implemented feature engineering techniques to standardize numerical features and encode categorical features, facilitating their use in the machine learning models.</li>
              <li><strong>Model Selection:</strong> Utilized Gradient Boosting and Decision Tree algorithms to capture non-linear relationships and compare their capabilities in predicting obesity risk levels.</li>
              <li><strong>Pipeline Creation:</strong> Developed a pipeline to streamline preprocessing and model application, ensuring seamless handling of testing data.</li>
              <li><strong>Model Optimization:</strong> Explored hyperparameter tuning and feature selection/creation to enhance the performance of the Decision Tree algorithm, aiming to improve precision for smaller sample classifications.</li>
